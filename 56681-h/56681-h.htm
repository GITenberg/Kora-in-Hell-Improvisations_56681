<h2>PROLOGUE</h2>

<h3>THE RETURN OF THE SUN</h3>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Her voice was like rose-fragrance waltzing in the wind.</div>
<div class="verse">She seemed a shadow, stained with shadow colors,</div>
<div class="verse">Swimming through waves of sunlight.…</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The sole precedent I can find for the broken style of my
prologue is Longinus on the Sublime and that one far-fetched.</p>

<p>When my mother was in Rome on that rare journey forever
to be remembered, she lived in a small pension near the Pincio
gardens. The place had been chosen by my brother as one
notably easy of access, being in a quarter free from confusion
of traffic, on a street close to the park and furthermore the tram
to the American Academy passed at the corner. Yet never did
my mother go out but she was in fear of being lost. By turning
to the left when she should have turned right, actually she did
once manage to go so far astray that it was nearly an hour before
she extricated herself from the strangeness of every new vista
and found a landmark.</p>

<p>There has always been a disreputable man of picturesque
personality associated with this lady. Their relations have been
marked by the most rollicking spirit of comradeship. Now it has
been William, former sailor in Admiral Dewey’s fleet at Manila,
then Tom O’Rourck who has come to her to do odd jobs and to
be cared for more or less when drunk or ill, their Penelope.
William would fall from the grapearbor much to my mother’s
amusement and delight and to his blustering discomfiture or he
would stagger to the back door nearly unconscious from bad
whiskey. There she would serve him with very hot and very
strong coffee, then put him to scrubbing the kitchen floor into
his suddy-pail pouring half a bottle of ammonia which would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
make the man gasp and water at the eyes as he worked and
became sober.</p>

<p>She has always been incapable of learning from benefit or
disaster. If a man cheat her she will remember that man with a
violence that I have seldom seen equaled but so far as that could
have an influence on her judgment of the next man or woman,
she might be living in Eden. And indeed she is, an impoverished,
ravished Eden but one indestructible as the imagination itself.
Whatever is before her is sufficient to itself and so to be valued.
Her meat though more delicate in fiber is of a kind with that of
Villon and La Grosse Margot:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Vente, gresle, gelle, j’ai mon pain cuit!</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Carl Sandburg sings a negro cotton picker’s song of the bol
weevil. Verse after verse tells what they would do to the insect.
They propose to place it in the sand, in hot ashes, in the river, and
other unlikely places but the bol weevil’s refrain is always:
“That’ll be ma HOME! That’ll be ma HOOME!”</p>

<p>My mother is given over to frequent periods of great depression
being as I believe by nature the most light-hearted thing in
the world. But there comes a grotesque turn to her talk, a
macabre anecdote concerning some dream, a passionate statement
about death, which elevates her mood without marring it, sometimes
in a most startling way.</p>

<p>Looking out at our parlor window one day I said to her:
“We see all the shows from here, don’t we, all the weddings and
funerals?” (They had been preparing a funeral across the street,
the undertaker was just putting on his overcoat.) She replied:
“Funny profession that, burying the dead people. I should think
they wouldn’t have any delusions of life left.” W.—Oh yes, it’s
merely a profession. M.—Hm. And how they study it! They
say sometimes people look terrible and they come and make them
look fine. They push things into their mouths! (Realistic gesture)
W.—Mama! M.—Yes, when they haven’t any teeth.</p>

<p>By some such dark turn at the end she raises her story out
of the commonplace: “Look at that chair, look at it! (The
plasterers had just left) If Mrs. J. or Mrs. D. saw that they
would have a fit.” W.—Call them in, maybe it will kill them.
M.—But they’re not near as bad as that woman, you know, her
husband was in the chorus,—has a little daughter Helen. Mrs.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
B. yes. She once wanted to take rooms here. I didn’t want her.
They told me: ‘Mrs. Williams, I heard you’re going to have Mrs.
B. <i>She</i> is particular.’ She said so herself. Oh no! Once she
burnt all her face painting under the sink.</p>

<p>Thus seeing the thing itself without forethought or afterthought
but with great intensity of perception my mother loses
her bearings or associates with some disreputable person or translates
a dark mood. She is a creature of great imagination. I
might say this is her sole remaining quality. She is a despoiled,
moulted castaway but by this power she still breaks life between
her fingers.</p>

<p class="tb">Once when I was taking lunch with Walter Arensberg at a
small place on 63rd St. I asked him if he could state what the
more modern painters were about, those roughly classed at that
time as “cubists”: Gleisze, Man Ray, Demuth, Du Champs—all of
whom were then in the city. He replied by saying that the only
way man differed from every other creature was in his ability to
improvise novelty and, since the pictorial artist was under discussion,
anything in paint that is truly new, truly a fresh creation
is good art. Thus according to Du Champs, who was Arensberg’s
champion at the time, a stained glass window that had fallen out
and lay more or less together on the ground was of far greater
interest than the thing conventionally composed <i>in situ</i>.</p>

<p>We returned to Arensberg’s sumptuous studio where he gave
further point to his remarks by showing me what appeared to be
the original of Du Champs’ famous, Nude Descending a Staircase.
But this, he went on to say, is a full-sized photographic print of
the first picture with many new touches by Du Champs himself
and so by the technique of its manufacture as by other means it
is a novelty!</p>

<p>Led on by these enthusiasms Arensberg has been an indefatigable
worker for the yearly salon of the Society of Independent
Artists, Inc. I remember the warmth of his description of a
pilgrimage to the home of that old Boston hermit who watched
over by a forbidding landlady (evidently in his pay) paints the
cigar-box-cover-like nudes upon whose fingers he presses actual
rings with glass jewels from the five and ten cent store.</p>

<p>I wish Arensberg had my opportunity for prying into jaded
households where the paintings of Mama’s and Papa’s flowertime
still hang on the walls. I propose that Arensberg be commissioned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
by the Independent Artists to scour the country for the
abortive paintings of those men and women who without master
or method have evolved perhaps two or three unusual creations
in their early years. I would start the collection with a painting
I have by a little English woman, A. E. Kerr, 1906, that in its
unearthly gaiety of flowers and sobriety of design possesses exactly
that strange freshness a spring day approaches without
attaining, an expansion of April, a thing this poor woman found
too costly for her possession—she could not swallow it as the
niggers do diamonds in the mines. Carefully selected these queer
products might be housed to good effect in some unpretentious
exhibition chamber across the city from the Metropolitan Museum
of Art. In the anteroom could be hung perhaps photographs of
prehistoric rock-paintings and etchings on horn: galloping bisons
and stags, the hind feet of which have been caught by the artist
in such a position that from that time until the invention of the
camera obscura, a matter of 6000 years or more, no one on earth
had again depicted that most delicate and expressive posture of
running.</p>

<p>The amusing controversy between Arensberg and Du Champs
on one side, and the rest of the hanging committee on the other as
to whether the porcelain urinal was to be admitted to the Palace
Exhibition of 1917 as a representative piece of American Sculpture
should not be allowed to slide into oblivion.</p>

<p>One day Du Champs decided that his composition for that
day would be the first thing that struck his eye in the first
hardware store he should enter. It turned out to be a pickaxe
which he bought and set up in his studio. This was his composition.
Together with Mina Loy and a few others Du Champs and
Arensberg brought out the paper, The Blind Man, to which Robert
Carlton Brown with his vision of suicide by diving from a high
window of the Singer Building contributed a few poems.</p>

<p>In contradistinction to their south, Marianne Moore’s statement
to me at the Chatham parsonage one afternoon—my wife
and I were just on the point of leaving—sets up a north: My
work has come to have just one quality of value in it: I will not
touch or have to do with those things which I detest. In this
austerity of mood she finds sufficient freedom for the play she
chooses.</p>

<p>Of all those writing poetry in America at the time she was
here Marianne Moore was the only one Mina Loy feared. By<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
divergent virtues these two women have achieved freshness of
presentation, novelty, freedom, break with banality.</p>

<p class="tb">When Margaret Anderson published my first improvisations
Ezra Pound wrote me one of his hurried letters in which he urged
me to give some hint by which the reader of good will might come
at my intention.</p>

<p>Before Ezra’s permanent residence in London, on one of his
trips to America—brought on I think by an attack of jaundice—he
was glancing through some book of my father’s. “It is not
necessary,” he said, “to read everything in a book in order to speak
intelligently of it. Don’t tell everybody I said so,” he added.</p>

<p>During this same visit my father and he had been reading
and discussing poetry together. Pound has always liked my father.
“I of course like your Old Man and I have drunk his Goldwasser.”
They were hot for an argument that day. My parent
had been holding forth in downright sentences upon my own
“idle nonsense” when he turned and became equally vehement
concerning something Ezra had written: what in heaven’s name
Ezra meant by “jewels” in a verse that had come between them.
These jewels,—rubies, sapphires, amethysts and what not, Pound
went on to explain with great determination and care, were the
backs of books as they stood on a man’s shelf. “But why in
heaven’s name don’t you say so then?” was my father’s triumphant
and crushing rejoinder.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="noindent">The letter: … God knows I have to work hard
enough to escape, not <i>propagande</i>, but getting centered

<p>(Bloody snob. ’eave a brick at ’im!!!).…</p>

Fizz, swish, gabble, and verbiage, these are <i>echt Americanisch</i>.</p>

<p>And alas, alas, poor old Masters. Look at Oct.
Poetry.</p>

<p>Let me indulge the American habit of quotation:</p>

<p class="tb">“Si le cosmopolitisme littéraire gagnait encore et
qu’il réussit à étaindre ce que les differénce de race ont
allumé de haine de sang parmi les hommes, j’y verrais
un gain pour la civilization et pour l’humanité tout
entière”.…</p>

<p>“L’amour excessif d’une patrie a pour immédiat
corollair l’horreur des patries étrangères. Non seulment
on craint de quitter la jupe de sa maman, d’aller
voir comment vivent les autres hommes, de se mêler à
leur luttes, de partager leur travaux, non seulment on
reste chez soi, mais on finit par fermer sa porte.”</p>

<p>“Cette folie gagne certains littérateurs et le même
professeur, en sortant d’expliquer le Cid ou Don Juan,
rédige de gracieuses injures contre Ibsen et l’influence,
hélas, trop illusoire, de son oevre, pourtant toute de
lumière et de beauté.” et cetera. Lie down and compose
yourself.</p>

</div>

<p>I like to think of the Greeks as setting out for the colonies in
Sicily and the Italian Peninsula. The Greek temperament lent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
itself to a certain symmetrical sculptural phase and to a fat
poetical balance of line that produced important work but I like
better the Greeks setting their backs to Athens. The ferment
was always richer in Rome, the dispersive explosion was always
nearer, the influence carried further and remained hot longer.
Hellenism, especially the modern sort, is too staid, too chilly, too
little fecundative to impregnate my world.</p>

<p>Hilda Doolittle before she began to write poetry or at least
before she began to show it to anyone would say: “You’re not
satisfied with me, are you Billy? There’s something lacking,
isn’t there?” When I was with her my feet always seemed to be
sticking to the ground while she would be walking on the tips of
the grass stems.</p>

<p>Ten years later as assistant editor of the Egoist she refers to
my long poem, March, which thanks to her own and her husband’s
friendly attentions finally appeared there in a purified form:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="right"><i>14 Aug. 1916</i></p>

<p class="noindent">Dear Bill:—</p>

<p>I trust you will not hate me for wanting to delete
from your poem all the flippancies. The reason I want
to do this is that the beautiful lines are so very beautiful—so
in the tone and spirit of your <i>Postlude</i>—(which to
me stands, a Nike, supreme among your poems). I
think there is <i>real</i> beauty—and real beauty is a rare and
sacred thing in this generation—in all the pyramid,
Ashur-ban-i-pal bits and in the Fiesole and in the wind
at the very last.</p>

<p>I don’t know what you think but I consider this
business of writing a very sacred thing!—I think you
have the “spark”—am sure of it, and when you speak
<i>direct</i> are a poet. I feel in the hey-ding-ding touch
running through your poem a derivitive tendency which,
to me, is not <i>you</i>—-not your very self. It is as if you
were <i>ashamed</i> of your Spirit, ashamed of your inspiration!—as
if you mocked at your own song. It’s very
well to <i>mock</i> at yourself—it is a spiritual sin to mock at
your inspiration—</p>

<p class="sig"><i>Hilda.</i></p>

</div>

<p>Oh well, all this might be very disquieting were it not that
“sacred” has lately been discovered to apply to a point of arrest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
where stabilization has gone on past the time. There is nothing
sacred about literature, it is damned from one end to the other.
There is nothing in literature but change and change is mockery.
I’ll write whatever I damn please, whenever I damn please and as
I damn please and it’ll be good if the authentic spirit of change is
on it.</p>

<p>But in any case H. D. misses the entire intent of what I am
doing no matter how just her remarks concerning that particular
poem happen to have been. The hey-ding-ding touch <i>was</i> derivitive
but it filled a gap that I did not know how better to fill at the
time. It might be said that that touch is the prototype of the
improvisations.</p>

<p>It is to the inventive imagination we look for deliverance
from every other misfortune as from the desolation of a flat
Hellenic perfection of style. What good then to turn to art from
the atavistic religionists, from a science doing slavey service upon
gas engines, from a philosophy tangled in a miserable sort of
dialect that means nothing if the full power of initiative be denied
at the beginning by a lot of baying and snapping scholiasts?
If the inventive imagination must look, as I think, to the field of
art for its richest discoveries today it will best make its way by
compass and follow no path.</p>

<p>But before any material progress can be accomplished there
must be someone to draw a discriminating line between true and
false values.</p>

<p>The true value is that peculiarity which gives an object a
character by itself. The associational or sentimental value is the
false. Its imposition is due to lack of imagination, to an easy
lateral sliding. The attention has been held too rigid on the one
plane instead of following a more flexible, jagged resort. It is
to loosen the attention, my attention since I occupy part of the
field, that I write these improvisations. Here I clash with Wallace
Stevens.</p>

<p>The imagination goes from one thing to another. Given
many things of nearly totally divergent natures but possessing
one-thousandth part of a quality in common, provided that be
new, distinguished, these things belong in an imaginative category
and not in a gross natural array. To me this is the gist of the
whole matter. It is easy to fall under the spell of a certain mode,
especially if it be remote of origin, leaving thus certain of its
members essential to a reconstruction of its significance permanently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
lost in an impenetrable mist of time. But the thing that
stands eternally in the way of really good writing is always one:
the virtual impossibility of lifting to the imagination those things
which lie under the direct scrutiny of the senses, close to the nose.
It is this difficulty that sets a value upon all works of art and
makes them a necessity. The senses witnessing what is immediately
before them in detail see a finality which they cling to in
despair, not knowing which way to turn. Thus the so-called
natural or scientific array becomes fixed, the walking devil of
modern life. He who even nicks the solidity of this apparition
does a piece of work superior to that of Hercules when he cleaned
the Augean stables.</p>

<p>Stevens’ letter applies really to my book of poems, “Al Que
Quiere” (which means, by the way, To Him Who Wants It) but
the criticism he makes of that holds good for each of the improvisations
if not for the <i>oevre</i> as a whole.</p>

<p>It begins with a postscript in the upper left hand corner:
“I think, after all, I should rather send this than not, although it is
quarrelsomely full of my own ideas of discipline.</p>

<p class="noindent">My dear Williams:</p>

<p class="center">…</p>

<p>What strikes me most about the poems themselves
is their casual character.… Personally I have a
distaste for miscellany. It is one of the reasons I do
not bother about a book myself.</p>

<p>(Wallace Stevens is a fine gentleman whom Cannell
likened to a Pennsylvania Dutchman who has suddenly
become aware of his habits and taken to “society” in
self defence. He is always immaculately dressed. I
don’t know why I should always associate him in my
mind with an imaginary image I have of Ford Madox
Hueffer.)</p>

<p>…My idea is that in order to carry a thing to the
extreme necessity to convey it one has to stick to it;…
Given a fixed point of view, realistic, imagistic or what
you will, everything adjusts itself to that point of view;
and the process of adjustment is a world in flux, as it
should be for a poet. But to fidget with points of view<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
leads always to new beginnings and incessant new beginnings
lead to sterility.</p>

<p class="center">(This sounds like Sir Roger de Coverly)</p>

<p>A single manner or mood thoroughly matured and exploited
is that fresh thing … etc.</p>

<p>One has to keep looking for poetry as Renoir
looked for colors in old walls, wood-work and so on.</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">A book of that would feed the hungry.…</p>

<p>Well a book of poems is a damned serious affair.
I am only objecting that a book that contains your
particular quality should contain anything else and suggesting
that if the quality were carried to a communicable
extreme, in intensity and volume, etc.… I see
it all over the book, in your landscapes and portraits,
but dissipated and obscured. Bouquets for brides and
Spencerian compliments for poets.… There are a
very few men who have anything native in them or for
whose work I’d give a Bolshevic ruble.… But I
think your tantrums not half mad enough.</p>

<p>(I am not quite clear about the last sentence but I
presume he means that I do not push my advantage
through to an overwhelming decision. What would
you have me do with my Circe, Stevens, now that I have
doublecrossed her game, marry her? It is not what
Odysseus did).</p>

<p>I return Pound’s letter … observe how in everything
he does he proceeds with the greatest positiveness
etc.</p>

<p>I wish that I might here set down my “Vortex” after the
fashion of London, 1913, stating how little it means to me whether
I live here, there or elsewhere or succeed in this, that or the other
so long as I can keep my mind free from the trammels of
literature, beating down every attack of its <i>retiarii</i> with my
<i>mirmillones</i>. But the time is past.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>

<p>I thought at first to adjoin to each improvisation a more or
less opaque commentary. But the mechanical interference that
would result makes this inadvisable. Instead I have placed some
of them in the preface where without losing their original intention
(see reference numerals at the beginning of each) they
relieve the later text and also add their weight to my present
fragmentary argument.</p>

<p class="tb">V. No. 2. By the brokeness of his composition the poet
makes himself master of a certain weapon which he could possess
himself of in no other way. The speed of the emotions is
sometimes such that thrashing about in a thin exaltation or
despair many matters are touched but not held, more often broken
by the contact.</p>

<p class="tb">II. No. 3. The instability of these improvisations would
seem such that they must inevitably crumble under the attention
and become particles of a wind that falters. It would appear to
the unready that the fiber of the thing is a thin jelly. It would be
these same fools who would deny touch cords to the wind because
they cannot split a storm endwise and wrap it upon spools. The
virtue of strength lies not in the grossness of the fiber but in the
fiber itself. Thus a poem is tough by no quality it borrows from
a logical recital of events nor from the events themselves but
solely from that attenuated power which draws perhaps many
broken things into a dance giving them thus a full being.</p>

<p class="tb">* * It is seldom that anything but the most elementary communications
can be exchanged one with another. There are in
reality only two or three reasons generally accepted as the causes
of action. No matter what the motive it will seldom happen that
true knowledge of it will be anything more than vaguely divined
by some one person, some half a person whose intimacy has
perhaps been cultivated over the whole of a lifetime. We live in
bags. This is due to the gross fiber of all action. By action
itself almost nothing can be imparted. The world of action is a
world of stones.</p>

<p class="tb">XV. No. 1. Bla! Bla! Bla! Heavy talk is talk that waits
upon a deed. Talk is servile that is set to inform. Words with
the bloom on them run before the imagination like the saeter girls<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
before Peer Gynt. It is talk with the patina of whim upon it
makes action a boot-licker. So nowadays poets spit upon rhyme
and rhetoric.</p>

<p class="tb">* * The stream of things having composed itself into wiry
strands that move in one fixed direction, the poet in desperation
turns at right angles and cuts across current with startling results
to his hangdog mood.</p>

<p class="tb">XI. No. 2. In France, the country of Rabelais, they know
that the world is not made up entirely of virgins. They do not
deny virtue to the rest because of that. Each age has its perfections
but the praise differs. It is only stupid when the praise of
the gross and the transformed would be minted in unfit terms
such as suit nothing but youth’s sweetness and frailty. It is necessary
to know that laughter is the reverse of aspiration. So
they laugh well in France, at Coquelin and the <i>Petoman</i>. Their
girls, also, thrive upon the love-making they get, so much so that
the world runs to Paris for that reason.</p>

<p class="tb">XII. No. 2 B. It is chuckleheaded to desire a way through
every difficulty. Surely one might even communicate with the
dead—and lose his taste for truffles. Because snails are slimy
when alive and because slime is associated (erroneously) with
filth the fool is convinced that snails are detestable when, as it is
proven every day, fried in butter with chopped parsely upon them,
they are delicious. This is both sides of the question: the slave
and the despoiled of his senses are one. But to weigh a difficulty
and to turn it aside without being wrecked upon a destructive
solution bespeaks an imagination of force sufficient to transcend
action. The difficulty has thus been solved by ascent to a higher
plane. It is energy of the imagination alone that cannot be laid
aside.</p>

<p class="tb">* * Rich as are the gifts of the imagination bitterness of
world’s loss is not replaced thereby. On the contrary it is intensified,
resembling thus possession itself. But he who has no
power of the imagination cannot even know the full of his injury.</p>

<p class="tb">VIII. No. 3. Those who permit their senses to be despoiled
of the things under their noses by stories of all manner of things<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
removed and unattainable are of frail imagination. Idiots, it is
true nothing is possessed save by dint of that vigorous conception
of its perfections which is the imagination’s special province but
neither is anything possessed which is not extant. A frail
imagination, unequal to the tasks before it, is easily led astray.</p>

<p class="tb">IV. No. 2. Although it is a quality of the imagination that it
seeks to place together those things which have a common relationship,
yet the coining of similies is a pastime of very low order,
depending as it does upon a nearly vegetable coincidence. Much
more keen is that power which discovers in things those inimitable
particles of dissimilarity to all other things which are the peculiar
perfections of the thing in question.</p>

<p>But this loose linking of one thing with another has effects
of a destructive power little to be guessed at: all manner of things
are thrown out of key so that it approaches the impossible to
arrive at an understanding of anything. All is confusion, yet, it
comes from a hidden desire for the dance, a lust of the imagination,
a will to accord two instruments in a duet.</p>

<p>But one does not attempt by the ingenuity of the joiner to
blend the tones of the oboe with the violin. On the contrary the
perfections of the two instruments are emphasized by the joiner;
no means is neglected to give to each the full color of its perfections.
It is only the music of the instruments which is joined and
that not by the woodworker but by the composer, by virtue of the
imagination.</p>

<p>On this level of the imagination all things and ages meet in
fellowship. Thus only can they, peculiar and perfect, find their
release. This is the beneficent power of the imagination.</p>

<p class="tb">* * Age and youth are great flatterers. Brooding on each
other’s obvious psychology neither dares tell the other outright
what manifestly is the truth: your world is poison. Each is
secure in his own perfections. Monsieur Eichorn used to
have a most atrocious body odor while the odor of some
girls is a pleasure to the nostril. Each quality in each person
or age, rightly valued, would mean the freeing of that age
to its own delights of action or repose. Now an evil odor can be
pursued with praise-worthy ardor leading to great natural activity
whereas a flowery skinned virgin may and no doubt often does
allow herself to fall into destructive habits of neglect.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>

<p class="tb">XIII. No. 3. A poet witnessing the chicory flower and
realizing its virtues of form and color so constructs his praise of
it as to borrow no particle from right or left. He gives his
poem over to the flower and its plant themselves that they may
benefit by those cooling winds of the imagination which thus
returned upon them will refresh them at their task of saving
the world. But what does it mean, remarked his friends?</p>

<p class="tb">VII. <i>Coda.</i> It would be better than depriving birds of their
song to call them all nightingales. So it would be better than to
have a world stript of poetry to provide men with some sort of
eyeglasses by which they should be unable to read any verse but
sonnets. But fortunately although there are many sorts of
fools, just as there are many birds which sing and many sorts of
poems, there is no need to please them.</p>

<p class="tb">* * All schoolmasters are fools. Thinking to build in the
young the foundations of knowledge they let slip their minds that
the blocks are of grey mist bedded upon the wind. Those who
will taste of the wind himself have a mark in their eyes by virtue
of which they bring their masters to nothing.</p>

<p class="tb">* * All things brought under the hand of the possessor
crumble to nothingness. Not only that: He who possesses a child
if he cling to it inordinately becomes childlike, whereas, with a
twist of the imagination, himself may rise into comradeship with
the grave and beautiful presences of antiquity. But some have
the power to free, say a young matron pursuing her infant, from
her own possessions, making her kin to Yang Kuei-fei because of
a haunting loveliness that clings about her knees, impeding her
progress as she takes up her matronly pursuit.</p>

<p class="tb">* * As to the sun what is he, save for his light, more than the
earth is: the same mass of metals, a mere shadow? But the
winged dawn is the very essence of the sun’s self, a thing cold,
vitreous, a virtue that precedes the body which it drags after it.</p>

<p class="tb">* * The features of a landscape take their position in the
imagination and are related more to their own kind there than to
the country and season which has held them hitherto as a basket
holds vegetables mixed with fruit.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>

<p>VI. No. 1. A fish swimming in a pond, were his back white
and his belly green, would be easily perceived from above by
hawks against the dark depths of water and from below by larger
fish against the penetrant light of the sky. But since his belly is
white and his back green he swims about in safety. Observing
this barren truth and discerning at once its slavish application to
the exercises of the mind, a young man, who has been sitting for
some time in contemplation at the edge of a lake, rejects with
scorn the parochial deductions of history and as scornfully asserts
his defiance.</p>

<p class="tb">XIV. No. 3. The barriers which keep the feet from the
dance are the same which in a dream paralyze the effort to escape
and hold us powerless in the track of some murderous pursuer.
Pant and struggle but you cannot move. The birth of the imagination
is like waking from a nightmare. Never does the night
seem so beneficent.</p>

<p class="tb">* * The raw beauty of ignorance that lies like an opal mist
over the west coast of the Atlantic, beginning at the Grand Banks
and extending into the recesses of our brains—the children, the
married, the unmarried—clings especially about the eyes and the
throats of our girls and boys. Of a Sunday afternoon a girl sits
before a mechanical piano and, working it with her hands and
feet, opens her mouth and sings to the music—a popular tune,
ragtime. It is a serenade. I have seen a young Frenchman lean
above the piano and looking down speak gently and wonderingly
to one of our girls singing such a serenade. She did not
seem aware of what she was singing and he smiled an occult but
thoroughly bewildered smile—as of a man waiting for a fog to
lift, meanwhile lost in admiration of its enveloping beauty—fragments
of architecture, a street opening and closing, a mysterious
glow of sunshine.</p>

<p class="tb">VIII. No. 1. A man of note upon examining the poems of
his friend and finding there nothing related to his immediate understanding
laughingly remarked: After all, literature is communication
while you, my friend, I am afraid, in attempting to do
something striking, are in danger of achieving mere presciosity.——But
inasmuch as the fields of the mind are vast and little explored,
the poet was inclined only to smile and to take note of that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
hardening infirmity of the imagination which seems to endow its
victim with great solidity and rapidity of judgment. But he
thought to himself: And yet of what other thing is greatness composed
than a power to annihilate half-truths for a thousandth part
of accurate understanding. Later life has its perfections as well
as that bough-bending time of the mind’s florescence with which I
am so discursively taken.</p>

<p class="tb">I have discovered that the thrill of first love passes! It even
becomes the backbone of a sordid sort of religion if not assisted
in passing. I knew a man who kept a candle burning before a
girl’s portrait day and night for a year—then jilted her,
pawned her off on a friend. I have been reasonably frank about
my erotics with my wife. I have never or seldom said, my dear
I love you, when I would rather say: My dear, I wish you
were in Tierra del Fuego. I have discovered by scrupulous
attention to this detail and by certain allied experiments that we
can continue from time to time to elaborate relationships quite
equal in quality, if not greatly superior, to that surrounding our
wedding. In fact, the best we have enjoyed of love together has
come after the most thorough destruction or harvesting of that
which has gone before. Periods of barrenness have intervened,
periods comparable to the prison music in Fidelio or to any of
Beethoven’s pianissimo transition passages. It is at these times
our formal relations have teetered on the edge of a debacle to be
followed, as our imaginations have permitted, by a new growth
of passionate attachment dissimilar in every member to that which
has gone before.</p>

<p>It is in the continual and violent refreshing of the idea that
love and good writing have their security.</p>

<p class="tb">Alfred Kreymborg is primarily a musician, at best an innovator
of musical phrase:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<div class="verse">to eat our meals from,</div>
<div class="verse">we have fingers</div>
<div class="verse">to eat our meals from.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Kreymborg’s idea of poetry is a transforming music that has
much to do with tawdry things.</p>

<p>Few people know how to read Kreymborg. There is no
modern poet who suffers more from a bastard sentimental appreciation.
It is hard to get his things from the page. I have heard
him say he has often thought in despair of marking his verse
into measures as music is marked. Oh, well—</p>

<p>The man has a bare irony, the gift of rhythm and Others. I
smile to think of Alfred stealing the stamps from the envelopes
sent for return of MSS. to the Others office! The best thing that
could happen for the good of poetry in the United States today
would be for someone to give Alfred Kreymborg a hundred
thousand dollars. In his mind there is the determination for
freedom brought into relief by a crabbedness of temper that
makes him peculiarly able to value what is being done here.
Whether he is bull enough for the work I am not certain, but that
he can find his way that I know.</p>

<p class="tb">A somewhat petulant English college friend of my brother’s
once remarked that Britons make the best policemen the world
has ever witnessed. I agree with him. It is silly to go into a
puckersnatch because some brass-button-minded nincompoop in
Kensington flies off the handle and speaks openly about our
United States prize poems. This Mr. Jepson—“Anyone who has
heard Mr. J. read Homer and discourse on Catullus would
recognize his fitness as a judge and respecter of poetry”—this
is Ezra!—this champion of the right is not half a fool. His
epithets and phrases—slip-shod, rank bad workmanship of a man
who has shirked his job, lumbering fakement, cumbrous artificiality,
maundering dribble, rancid as Ben Hur—are in the main
well-merited. And besides, he comes out with one fairly lipped
cornet blast: the only distinctive U. S. contributions to the arts
have been ragtime and buck-dancing.</p>

<p>Nothing is good save the new. If a thing have novelty it
stands intrinsically beside every other work of artistic excellence.
If it have not that, no loveliness or heroic proportion or grand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
manner will save it. It will not be saved above all by an attenuated
intellectuality.</p>

<p>But all U. S. verse is not bad according to Mr. J., there is
T. S. Eliot and his, Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock.</p>

<p>But our prize poems are especially to be damned not because
of superficial bad workmanship, but because they are rehash,
repetition—just as Eliot’s more exquisite work is rehash,
repetition in another way of Verlaine, Beaudelaire, Maeterlinck,—conscious
or unconscious,—just as there were Pound’s
early paraphrases from Yeats and his constant later cribbing
from the renaissance, Provence and the modern French: Men
content with the connotations of their masters.</p>

<p>It is convenient to have fixed standards of comparison: All
antiquity! And there is always some everlasting Polonius of
Kensington forever to rate highly his eternal Eliot. It is because
Eliot is a subtle conformist. It tickles the palate of this archbishop
of procurers to a lecherous antiquity to hold up Prufrock
as a New World type. Prufrock, the nibbler at sophistication,
endemic in every capital, the not quite (because he refuses to
turn his back), is “the soul of that modern land,” the United
States!</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Blue undershirts,</div>
<div class="verse">Upon a line,</div>
<div class="verse">It is not secessary to say to you</div>
<div class="verse">Anything about it—</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>I cannot question Eliot’s observation. Prufrock is a masterly
portrait of the man just below the summit, but the type is universal;
the model in his case might be Mr. J.</p>

<p>No. The New World is Montezuma or since he was stoned
to death in a parley, Guatemozin who had the city of Mexico
levelled over him before he was taken.</p>

<p>For the rest, there is no man even though he dare who can
make beauty his own and “so at last live,” at least there is no
man better situated for that achievement than another. As Prufrock
longed for his silly lady so Kensington longs for its Hardanger
dairymaid. By a mere twist of the imagination, if Prufrock
only knew it, the whole world can be inverted (why else are
there wars?) and the mermaids be set warbling to whoever will
listen to them. Seesaw and blind-man’s-buff converted into a
sort of football.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>

<p>But the summit of United States achievement, according to
Mr. J.—who can discourse on Catullus—is that very beautiful
poem of Eliot’s, La Figlia Que Piange: just the right amount of
everything drained through, etc., etc., etc., etc., the rhythm
delicately studied and—IT CONFORMS! ergo here we have
“the very fine flower of the finest spirit of the United States.”</p>

<p>Examined closely this poem reveals a highly refined distillation.
Added to the already “faithless” formula of yesterday we
have a conscious simplicity:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Simple and faithless as a smile and shake of the hand.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The perfection of that line is beyond cavil. Yet, in the last
stanza, this paradigm, this very fine flower of U. S. art is warped
out of alignment, obscured in meaning even to the point of an
absolute unintelligibility by the inevitable straining after a rhyme,
the very cleverness with which this straining is covered being a
sinister token in itself.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">And I wonder how they should have been together!</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">So we have no choice but to accept the work of this fumbling
conjurer.</p>

<p>Upon the Jepson filet Eliot balances his mushroom. It is the
latest touch from the literary cuisine, it adds to the pleasant outlook
from the club window. If to do this, if to be a Whistler at
best, in the art of poetry, is to reach the height of poetic expression
then Ezra and Eliot have approached it and <i>tant pis</i> for the
rest of us.</p>

<p>The Adobe Indian hag sings her lullaby:</p>

<p class="noindent">and Kandinsky in his, <i>Ueber das Geistige in der Kunst</i>, sets down
the following axioms for the artist:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Every artist has to express himself</div>
<div class="verse">Every artist has to express his epoch.</div>
<div class="verse">Every artist has to express the pure and eternal qualities of the art of all men.</div>

<p>So we have the fish and the bait, but the last rule holds three hooks
at once—not for the fish, however.</p>

<p>I do not overlook De Gourmont’s plea for a meeting of the
nations, but I do believe that when they meet Paris will be more
than slightly abashed to find parodies of the middle ages, Dante
and Langue D’Oc foisted upon it as the best in United States
poetry. Even Eliot, who is too fine an artist to allow himself
to be exploited by a blockheaded grammaticaster, turns recently
toward “one definite false note” in his quatrains, which more
nearly approach America than ever La Figlia Que Piange did.
Ezra Pound is a Boscan who has met his Navagiero.</p>

<p>One day Ezra and I were walking down a back lane in
Wyncote. I contended for bread, he for caviar. I become hot.
He, with fine discretion, exclaimed: “Let us drop it. We will
never agree, or come to an agreement.” He spoke then like a
Frenchman, which is one who discerns.</p>

<p>Imagine an international congress of poets at Paris or Versailles,
Remy de Gourmont (now dead) presiding, poets all
speaking five languages fluently. Ezra stands up to represent
U. S. verse and De Gourmont sits down smiling. Ezra begins by
reading, La Figlia Que Piange. It would be a pretty pastime to
gather into a mental basket the fruits of that reading from the
minds of the ten Frenchmen present; their impressions of the
sort of United States that very fine flower was picked from.
After this Kreymborg might push his way to the front and read
Jack’s House.</p>

<p>E. P. is the best enemy United States verse has. He is
interested, passionately interested—even if he doesn’t know what
he is talking about. But of course he does know what he is talking
about. He does not, however, know everything, not by more
than half. The accordances of which Americans have the parts
and the colors but not the completions before them pass beyond
the attempts of his thought. It is a middle aging blight of the
Imagination.</p>

<p>I praise those who have the wit and courage, and the conventionality,
to go direct toward their vision of perfection in an
objective world where the sign-posts are clearly marked, viz., to
London. But confine them in hell for their paretic assumption
that there is no alternative but their own groove.</p>

<p>Dear fat Stevens, thawing out so beautifully at forty! I
was one day irately damning those who run to London when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
Stevens caught me up with his mild: “But where in the world
will you have them run to?”</p>

<p class="tb">Nothing that I should write touching poetry would be complete
without Maxwell Bodenheim in it, even had he not said
that the Improvisations were “perfect,” the best things I had ever
done; for that I place him, Janus, first and last.</p>

<p>Bodenheim pretends to hate most people, including Pound
and Kreymborg, but that he really goes to this trouble I cannot
imagine. He seems rather to me to have the virtue of self absorbtion
so fully developed that hate is made impossible. Due to
this, also, he is an unbelievable physical stoic. I know of no one
who lives so completely in his pretences as Bogie does. Having
formulated his world neither toothache nor the misery to which
his indolence reduces him can make head against the force of his
imagination. Because of this he remains for me a heroic figure,
which, after all, is quite apart from the stuff he writes and which
only concerns him. He is an Isaiah of the butterflies.</p>

<p>Bogie was the young and fairly well acclaimed genius when
he came to New York four years ago. He pretended to have
fallen in Chicago and to have sprained his shoulder. The joint
was done up in a proper Sayre’s dressing and there really looked
to be a bona fide injury. Of course he couldn’t find any work to
do with one hand so we all chipped in. It lasted a month!
During that time Bogie spent a week at my house at no small
inconvenience to Florence, who had two babies on her hands
just then. When he left I expressed my pleasure at having had
his company. “Yes,” he replied, “I think you have profited by
my visit.” The statement impressed me by its simple accuracy as
well as by the evidence it bore of that fullness of the imagination
which had held the man in its tide while we had been
together.</p>

<p>Charlie Demuth once told me that he did not like the taste of
liquor, for which he was thankful, but that he found the effect it
had on his mind to be delightful. Of course Li Po is reported to
have written his best verse supported in the arms of the Emperor’s
attendants and with a dancing-girl to hold his tablet. He
was also a great poet. Wine is merely the latchstring.</p>

<p>The virtue of it all is in an opening of the doors, though
some rooms of course will be empty, a break with banality, the
continual hardening which habit enforces. There is nothing left<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
in me but the virtue of curiosity, Demuth puts in. The poet
should be forever at the ship’s prow.</p>

<p>An acrobat seldom learns really a new trick, but he must
exercise continually to keep his joints free. When I made this
discovery it started rings in my memory that keep following one
after the other to this day.</p>

<p>I have placed the following Improvisations in groups, somewhat
after the A. B. A. formula, that one may support the other,
clarifying or enforcing perhaps the other’s intention.</p>

<p>The arrangement of the notes, each following its poem and
separated from it by a ruled line, is borrowed from a small volume
of Metastasio, <i>Varie Poesie Dell’ Abate Pietro Metastasio</i>,
Venice, 1795.</p>

<p>Fools have big wombs. For the rest?—here is pennyroyal
if one knows to use it. But time is only another liar, so go along
the wall a little further: if blackberries prove bitter there’ll be
mushrooms, fairy-ring mushrooms, in the grass, sweetest of all
fungi.</p>

<p>For what it’s worth: Jacob Louslinger, white haired, stinking,
dirty bearded, cross eyed, stammer tongued, broken voiced, bent
backed, ball kneed, cave bellied, mucous faced—deathling,—found
lying in the weeds “up there by the cemetery”. “Looks
to me as if he’d been bumming around the meadows for a couple
of weeks”. Shoes twisted into incredible lilies: out at the toes,
heels, tops, sides, soles. Meadow flower! ha, mallow! at last I
have you. (Rot dead marigolds—an acre at a time! Gold, are
you?) Ha, clouds will touch world’s edge and the great pink
mallow stand singly in the wet, topping reeds and—a closet full of
clothes and good shoes and my-thirty-year’s-master’s-daughter’s
two cows for me to care for and a winter room with a fire in it—.
I would rather feed pigs in Moonachie and chew calamus root
and break crab’s claws at an open fire: age’s lust loose!</p>

<h4>3</h4>

<p>Talk as you will, say: “No woman wants to bother with
children in this country”;—speak of your Amsterdam and the
whitest aprons and brightest doorknobs in Christendom. And I’ll
answer you: “Gleaming doorknobs and scrubbed entries have
heard the songs of the housemaids at sun-up and—housemaids
are wishes. Whose? Ha! the dark canals are whistling,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
whistling for who will cross to the other side. If I remain with
hands in pocket leaning upon my lamppost—why—I bring curses
to a hag’s lips and her daughter on her arm knows better than I
can tell you—best to blush and out with it than back beaten after.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><i>In Holland at daybreak, of a fine spring morning, one sees the
housemaids beating rugs before the small houses of such a city as
Amsterdam, sweeping, scrubbing the low entry steps and polishing
doorbells and doorknobs. By night perhaps there will be an old
woman with a girl on her arm, histing and whistling across a
deserted canal to some late loiterer trudging aimlessly on beneath
the gas lamps.</i></p>

<p>Why go further? One might conceivably rectify the rhythm,
study all out and arrive at the perfection of a tiger lily or a china
doorknob. One might lift all out of the ruck, be a worthy
successor to—the man in the moon. Instead of breaking the
back of a willing phrase why not try to follow the wheel
through—approach death at a walk, take in all the scenery.
There’s as much reason one way as the other and then—one
never knows—perhaps we’ll bring back Euridice—this time!</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><i>Between two contending forces there may at all times arrive
that moment when the stress is equal on both sides so that with a
great pushing a great stability results giving a picture of perfect
rest. And so it may be that once upon the way the end drives
back upon the beginning and a stoppage will occur. At such a
time the poet shrinks from the doom that is calling him forgetting
the delicate rhythms of perfect beauty, preferring in his mind the
gross buffetings of good and evil fortune.</i></p>

<p><i>Ay dio!</i> I could say so much were it not for the tunes
changing, changing, darting so many ways. One step and the
cart’s left you sprawling. Here’s the way! and—you’re hip bogged.
And there’s blame of the light too: when eyes are humming
birds who’ll tie them with a lead string? But it’s the tunes they
want most,—send them skipping out at the tree tops. Whistle
then! who’ld stop the leaves swarming; curving down the east
in their braided jackets? Well enough—but there’s small
comfort in naked branches when the heart’s not set that way.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><i>A man’s desire is to win his way to some hilltop. But against
him seem to swarm a hundred jumping devils. These are his
constant companions, these are the friendly images which he has
invented out of his mind and which are inviting him to rest and
to disport himself according to hidden reasons. The man being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
half a poet is cost down and longs to rid himself of his torment
and his tormentors.</i></p>

<p>When you hang your clothes on the line you do not expect to
see the line broken and them trailing in the mud. Nor would
you expect to keep your hands clean by putting them in a dirty
pocket. However and of course if you are a market man, fish,
cheeses and the like going under your fingers every minute in the
hour you would not leave off the business and expect to handle
a basket of fine laces without at least mopping yourself on a
towel, soiled as it may be. Then how will you expect a fine
trickle of words to follow you through the intimacies of this
dance without—oh, come let us walk together into the air awhile
first. One must be watchman to much secret arrogance before
his ways are tuned to these measures. You see there is a dip of
the ground between us. You think you can leap up from your
gross caresses of these creatures and at a gesture fling it all off
and step out in silver to my finger tips. Ah, it is not that I do
not wait for you, always! But my sweet fellow—you have broken
yourself without purpose, you are—Hark! it is the music!
Whence does it come? What! Out of the ground? Is it this
that you have been preparing for me? Ha, goodbye, I have a
rendez vous in the tips of three birch sisters. <i>Encouragé vos
musiciens!</i> Ask them to play faster. I will return—later. Ah
you are kind. —and I? must dance with the wind, make my own
snow flakes, whistle a contrapuntal melody to my own fuge!
Huzza then, this is the dance of the blue moss bank! Huzza
then, this is the mazurka of the hollow log! Huzza then, this
is the dance of rain in the cold trees.</p>

<p>So far away August green as it yet is. They say the sun
still comes up o’mornings and it’s harvest moon now. Always
one leaf at the peak twig swirling, swirling and apples rotting in
the ditch.</p>

<p>My wife’s uncle went to school with Amundsen. After he,
Amundsen, returned from the south pole there was a Scandinavian
dinner, which bored Amundsen like a boyhood friend. There
was a young woman at his table, silent and aloof from the rest.
She left early and he restless at some impalpable delay apologized
suddenly and went off with two friends, his great, lean bulk
twitching agilely. One knew why the poles attracted him.
Then my wife’s mother told me the same old thing, how a girl in
their village jilted him years back. But the girl at the supper!
Ah—that comes later when we are wiser and older.</p>

<p>What can it mean to you that a child wears pretty clothes
and speaks three languages or that its mother goes to the best
shops? It means: July has good need of his blazing sun. But
if you pick one berry from the ash tree I’d not know it again for
the same no matter how the rain washed. Make my bed of
witchhazel twigs, said the old man, since they bloom on the brink
of winter.</p>

<p><i>There is neither beginning nor end to the imagination but it
delights in its own seasons reversing the usual order at will.
Of the air of the coldest room it will seem to build the hottest
passions. Mozart would dance with his wife, whistling his own
tune to keep the cold away and Villon ceased to write upon his
Petit Testament only when the ink was frozen. But men in the
direst poverty of the imagination buy finery and indulge in
extravagant moods in order to piece out their lack with other
matter.</i></p>

<p>Mamselle Day, Mamselle Day, come back again! Slip your
clothes off!—the jingling of those little shell ornaments so
deftly fastened—! The streets are turning in their covers.
They smile with shut eyes. I have been twice to the moon since
supper but she has nothing to tell me. Mamselle come back!
I will be wiser this time.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><i>That which is past is past forever and no power of the
imagination can bring it back again. Yet inasmuch as there
are many lives being lived in the world, by virtue of sadness and
regret we are enabled to partake to some small degree of those
pleasures we have missed or lost but which others more fortunate
than we are in the act of enjoying.</i></p>

<p>If one should catch me in this state! —wings would go at
a bargain. Ah but to hold the world in the hand then— Here’s
a brutal jumble. And if you move the stones, see the ants scurry.
But it’s queen’s eggs they take first, tax their jaws most. Burrow,
burrow, burrow! there’s sky that way too if the pit’s deep
enough—so the stars tell us.</p>

<p><i>It is an obsession of the gifted that by direct onslaught or
by some back road of the intention they will win the recognition
of the world. Cezanne. And inasmuch as some men have had a
bare recognition in their lives the fiction is continued. But the
sad truth is that since the imagination is nothing, nothing will
come of it. Thus those necessary readjustments of sense which
are the everyday affair of the mind are distorted and intensified in
these individuals so that they frequently believe themselves to be
the very helots of fortune, whereas nothing could be more ridiculous
than to suppose this. However their strength will revive if
it may be and finding a sweetness on the tongue of which they had
no foreknowledge they set to work again with renewed vigor.</i></p>

<p>How smoothly the car runs. And these rows of celery, how
they bitter the air—winter’s authentic foretaste. Here among
these farms how the year has aged, yet here’s last year and the
year before and all years. One might rest here time without end,
watch out his stretch and see no other bending than spring to
autumn, winter to summer and earth turning into leaves and
leaves into earth and—how restful these long beet rows—the
caress of the low clouds—the river lapping at the reeds. Was it
ever so high as this, so full? How quickly we’ve come this far.
Which way is north now? North now? why that way I think.
Ah there’s the house at last, here’s April, but—the blinds are
down! It’s all dark here. Scratch a hurried note. Slip it over
the sill. Well, some other time.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>How smoothly the car runs. This must be the road. Queer
how a road juts in. How the dark catches among those trees!
How the light clings to the canal! Yes there’s one table taken,
we’ll not be alone. This place has possibilities. Will you bring
<i>her</i> here? Perhaps—and when we meet on the stair, shall we
speak, say it is some acquaintance—or pass silent? Well, a jest’s
a jest but how poor this tea is. Think of a life in this place,
here in these hills by these truck farms. Whose life? Why
there, back of you. If a woman laughs a little loudly one always
thinks that way of her. But how she bedizens the country-side.
Quite an old world glamour. If it were not for—but one cannot
have everything. What poor tea it was. How cold it’s grown.
Cheering, a light is that way among the trees. That heavy
laugh! How it will rattle these branches in six weeks’ time.</p>

<p>The frontispiece is her portrait and further on—the obituary
sermon: she held the school upon her shoulders. Did she.
Well—turn in here then:—we found money in the blood and some
in the room and on the stairs. My God I never knew a man had
so much blood in his head! —and thirteen empty whisky
bottles. I am sorry but those who come this way meet strange
company. This is you see death’s canticle.</p>

<p><i>A young woman who had excelled at intellectual pursuits,
a person of great power in her sphere, died on the same night
that a man was murdered in the next street, a fellow of very
gross behavior. The poet takes advantage of this to send them
on their way side by side without making the usual unhappy
moral distinctions.</i></p>

<p>Beautiful white corpse of night actually! So the north-west
winds of death are mountain sweet after all! All the troubled
stars are put to bed now: three bullets from wife’s hand none
kindlier: in the crown, in the nape and one lower: three starlike
holes among a million pocky pores and the moon of your mouth:
Venus, Jupiter, Mars, and all stars melted forthwith into this
one good white light over the inquest table,—the traditional moth
beating its wings against it—except there are two here. But
sweetest are the caresses of the county physician, a little clumsy
perhaps—<i>mais</i>—! and the Prosecuting Attorney, Peter Valuzzi
and the others, waving green arms of maples to the tinkling of
the earliest ragpicker’s bells. Otherwise—: kindly stupid hands,
kindly coarse voices, infinitely soothing, infinitely detached,
infinitely beside the question, restfully babbling of how, where,
why and night is done and the green edge of yesterday has
said all it could.</p>

<p><i>Remorse is a virtue in that it is a stirrer up of the emotions
but it is a folly to accept it as a criticism of conduct. So to
accept it is to attempt to fit the emotions of a certain state to a
preceding state to which they are in no way related. Imagination
though it cannot wipe out the sting of remorse can instruct
the mind in its proper uses.</i></p>

<p>It is the water we drink. It bubbles under every hill. How?
Agh, you stop short of the root. Why, caught and the town goes
mad. The haggard husband pirouettes in tights. The wolf-lean
wife is rolling butter pats: it’s a clock striking the hour. Pshaw,
they do things better in Bangkok,—here too, if there’s heads
together. But up and leap at her throat! Bed’s at fault!
Yet—I’ve seen three women prostrate, hands twisted in each
other’s hair, teeth buried where the hold offered,—not a movement,
not a cry more than a low meowling. Oh call me a lady
and think you’ve caged me. Hell’s loose every minute, you hear?
And the truth is there’s not an eye clapped to either way but
someone comes off the dirtier for it. Who am I to wash hands<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
and stand near the wall? I confess freely there’s not a bitch
littered in the pound but my skin grows ruddier. Ask me and
I’ll say: curfew for the ladies. Bah, two in the grass is the
answer to that gesture. Here’s a text for you: Many daughters
have done virtuously but thou excellest them all! And so you
do, if the manner of a walk means anything. You walk in a
different air from the others,—though your husband’s the better
man and the charm won’t last a fortnight: the street’s kiss parried
again. But give thought to your daughters’ food at mating
time, you good men. Send them to hunt spring beauties beneath
the sod this winter,—otherwise: hats off to the lady! One can
afford to smile.</p>

<p>Marry in middle life and take the young thing home. Later
in the year let the worst out. It’s odd how little the tune changes.
Do worse—till your mind’s turning, then rush into repentence
and the lady grown a hero while the clock strikes.</p>

<p>Here the harps have a short cadenza. It’s sunset back of
the new cathedral and the purple river scum has set seaward.
The car’s at the door. I’d not like to go alone tonight. I’ll pay
you well. It’s the kings-evil. Speed! Speed! The sun’s
self’s a chancre low in the west. Ha, how the great houses shine—for
old time’s sake! For sale! For sale! The town’s gone
another way. But I’m not fooled that easily. <i>Fort sale! Fort
sale!</i> if you read it aright. And Beauty’s own head on the
pillow, <i>à la Muja Desnuda</i>! <i>O Contessa de Alba! Contessa de
Alba!</i> Never was there such a lewd wonder in the streets of
Newark! Open the windows—but all’s boarded up here. Out
with you, you sleepy doctors and lawyers you,—the sky’s afire

pondering on the sights he sees as he is driven up one street and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
down another. It being evening he witnesses a dawn of great
beauty striking backward upon the world in a reverse direction
to the sun’s course and not knowing of what else to think discovers
it to be the same power which has led his companion to
destruction. At this he is inclined to scoff derisively at the city’s
prone stupidity and to make light indeed of his friend’s misfortune.</i></p>

wear a mitre in that year? Come, there’s much use in being thin

blessing to all women. At the same time it is idle to quarrel
over the relative merits of one thing and another, oak leaves
will not come on maples. But there is a deeper folly yet in such
quarreling: the perfections revealed by a Rembrandt are equal

cast over a Titian Venus by two eyes quicker than Titian’s hands
were, some strange daughter of an inn-keeper,—some.… Call
it a net to catch love’s twin doves and I’ll say to you: Look!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>

<p>It is still warm enough to slip from the weeds into the lake’s
edge, your clothes blushing in the grass and three small boys
grinning behind the derelict hearth’s side. But summer is up
among the huckleberries near the path’s end and snakes’ eggs lie
curling in the sun on the lonely summit. But—well—let’s wish
it were higher after all these years staring at it deplore the
paunched clouds glimpse the sky’s thin counter-crest and plunge
into the gulch. Sticky cobwebs tell of feverish midnights.
Crack a rock (what’s a thousand years!) and send it crashing
among the oaks! Wind a pine tree in a grey-worm’s net and
play it for a trout; oh—but it’s the moon does that! No, summer

shoulders: a clear middle A touched by a master—but he cannot

music. And white haired Miss Ball! The empty school is
humming to her little melody played with one finger at the noon
hour but it is beyond them all. There is much heavy breathing,
many tight shut lips, a smothered laugh whiles, two laughs cracking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>

to be so complacent of their lot, floating as they are with the
depth of a sea beneath them, as to be worthy only of amused

Yes, it’s a good view. Come, let’s visit the orchard. Here’s

Those hills! Those hills! But you’ld be young again! Well,

the pricks in, but though there’s more in a song than the notes of
it and a smile’s a pretty baby when you’ve none other—let’s not
turn backward. Mumble the words, you understand, call them

Coil and uncoil! Whip yourselves about! Shout the deliverence!
An old woman has infected her blossomy grand-daughter

sometimes send down rain or snow or hail. This is the language
to which few ears are tuned so that it is said by poets that few
men are ever in their full senses since they have no way to use
their imaginations. Thus to say that a man has no imagination
is to say nearly that he is blind or deaf. But of old poets would
translate this hidden language into a kind of replica of the speech
of the world with certain distinctions of rhyme and meter to show
that it was not really that speech. Nowadays the elements of

<p><i>Per le pillole d’Ercole!</i> I should write a happy poem tonight.
It would have to do with a bare, upstanding fellow whose thighs
bulge with a zest for—say, a zest! He tries his arm. Flings a
stone over the river. Scratches his bare back. Twirls his beard,
laughs softly and stretches up his arms in a yawn. —stops in
the midst—looking! A white flash over against the oak stems!
Draws in his belly. Looks again. In three motions is near the
stream’s middle, swinging forward, hugh, hugh, hugh, hugh,
blinking his eyes against the lapping wavelets! Out! and the
sting of the thicket!</p>

of a white skinned dryad. The gaiety of his mood full of lustihood,
even so, turns back with a mocking jibe.</i></p>

<p>Giants in the dirt. The gods, the Greek gods, smothered
in filth and ignorance. The race is scattered over the world.
Where is its home? Find it if you’ve the genius. Here Hebe
with a sick jaw and a cruel husband,—her mother left no place
for a brain to grow. Herakles rowing boats on Berry’s Creek!
Zeus is a country doctor without a taste for coin jingling. Supper
is of a bastard nectar on rare nights for they will come—the
rare nights! The ground lifts and out sally the heroes of
Sophocles, of Æschylus. They go seeping down into our hearts,
they rain upon us and in the bog they sink again down through
the white roots, down—to a saloon back of the rail-road switch
where they have that girl, you know, the one that should have
been Venus by the lust that’s in her. They’ve got her down there
among the railroad men. A crusade couldn’t rescue her. Up to
jail—or call it down to Limbo—the Chief of Police our Pluto.
It’s all of the gods, there’s nothing else worth writing of. They
are the same men they always were—but fallen. Do they dance
now, they that danced beside Helicon? They dance much as they
did then, only, few have an eye for it, through the dirt and
fumes.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>
<p><i>When they came to question the girl before the local judge
it was discovered that there were seventeen men more or less
involved so that there was nothing to do but to declare the child
a common bastard and send the girl about her business. Her
mother took her in and after the brat died of pneumonia a year
later she called in the police one day. An officer opened the
bedroom door. The girl was in bed with an eighteenth fellow,
a young roaming loafer with a silly grin to his face. They forced
a marriage which relieved the mother of her burden. The girl
was weak minded so that it was only with the greatest difficulty
that she could cover her moves, in fact she never could do so with
success.</i></p>

<p>Homer sat in a butcher’s shop one rainy night and smelt
fresh meat near him so he moved to the open window. It is
infinitely important that I do what I well please in the world.
What you please is that I please what you please but what I please
is well rid of you before I turn off from the path into the field.
What I am, why that they made me. What I do, why that I
choose for myself. Reading shows, you say. Yes, reading
shows reading. What you read is what they think and what they
think is twenty years old or twenty thousand and it’s all one to
the little girl in the <i>pissoir</i>. Likewise to me. But the butcher

<p>Little round moon up there—wait awhile—do not walk so
quickly. I could sing you a song—: Wine clear the sky is and
the stars no bigger than sparks! Wait for me and next winter
we’ll build a fire and shake up twists of sparks out of it and you

have chosen—but all’s right now. They said I could not put the
flower back into the stem nor win roses upon dead briars and I
like a fool believed them. But all’s right now. Weave away,
dead fingers, the darkies are dancing in Mayaguez—all but one
with the sore heel and sugar cane will soon be high enough to
romp through. Haia! leading over the ditches, with your skirts
flying and the devil in the wind back of you—no one else.
Weave away and the bitter tongue of an old woman is eating,
eating, eating venomous words with thirty years mould on them
and all shall be eaten back to honeymoon’s end. Weave and
pangs of agony and pangs of loneliness are beaten backward into
the love kiss, weave and kiss recedes into kiss and kisses into
looks and looks into the heart’s dark—and over again and over
again and time’s pushed ahead in spite of all that. The petals
that fell bearing me under are lifted one by one. That which
kissed my flesh for priest’s lace so that I could not touch it—weave
and you have lifted it and I am glimpsing light chinks
among the notes! Backward, and my hair is crisp with purple
sap and the last crust’s broken.</p>

<p>How deftly we keep love from each other. It is no trick at
all: the movement of a cat that leaps a low barrier. You have—if
the truth be known—loved only one man and that was before
my time. Past him you have never thought nor desired to think.
In his perfections you are perfect. You are likewise perfect in
other things. You present to me the surface of a marble. And
I, we will say, loved also before your time. Put it quite
obscenely. And I have my perfections. So here we present
ourselves to each other naked. What have we effected? Say
we have aged a little together and you have borne children. We
have in short thriven as the world goes. We have proved fertile.
The children are apparently healthy. One of them is even
whimsical and one has an unusual memory and a keen eye.
But—It is not that we have not felt a certain rumbling, a certain
stirring of the earth but what has it amounted to? Your first
love and mine were of different species. There is only one way
out. It is   for me to take up my basket of words and for you to
sit at your piano, each his own way, until I have, if it so be that
good fortune smile my way, made a shrewd bargain at some fair
and so by dint of heavy straining supplanted in your memory the
brilliance of the old firmhold. Which is impossible. Ergo: I
am a blackguard.</p>

the act, to win its praise, will win it in diverse fashions according
to the way the imagination has taken. Thus a harsh deed will
sometimes win its praise through laughter and sometimes through
savage mockery, and a deed of simple kindness will come to its
reward through sarcastic comment. Each thing is secure in its
own perfections.</i></p>

<p>After thirty years staring at one true phrase he discovered
that its opposite was true also. For weeks he laughed in the grip
of a fierce self derision. Having lost the falsehood to which he’d
fixed his hawser he rolled drunkenly about the field of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
environment before the new direction began to dawn upon his
cracked mind. What a fool ever to be tricked into seriousness.
Soft hearted, hard hearted. Thick crystals began to shoot
through the liquid of his spirit. Black, they were: branches that
have lain in a fog which now a wind is blowing away. Things
move. Fatigued as you are watch how the mirror sieves out the
extraneous: in sleep as in waking. Summoned to his door by a
tinkling bell he looked into a white face, the face of a man
convulsed with dread, saw the laughter back of its drawn alertness.
Out in the air: the sidesplitting burlesque of a sparkling
midnight stooping over a little house on a sandbank. The city at
the horizon blowing a lurid red against the flat cloud. The moon
masquerading for a tower clock over the factory, its hands in a
gesture that, were time real, would have settled all. But the
delusion convulses the leafless trees with the deepest appreciation
of the mummery: insolent poking of a face upon the half-lit window
from which the screams burst. So the man alighted in the
great silence, with a myopic star blinking to clear its eye over his
hat top. He comes to do good. Fatigue tickles his calves and
the lower part of his back with solicitous fingers, strokes his feet
and his knees with appreciative charity. He plunges up the dark
steps on his grotesque deed of mercy. In his warped brain an
owl of irony fixes on the immediate object of his care as if it
were the thing to be destroyed, guffaws at the impossibility of
putting any kind of value on the object inside or of even reversing
or making less by any other means than induced sleep—which is
no solution—the methodical gripe of the sufferer. Stupidity
couched in a dingy room beside the kitchen. One room stove-hot,
the next the dead cold of a butcher’s ice box. The man
leaned and cut the baby from its stem. Slop in disinfectant, roar
with derision at the insipid blood stench: hallucination comes to
the rescue on the brink of seriousness: the gas-stove flame is
starblue, violets back of L’Orloge at Lancy. The smile of a
spring morning trickles into the back of his head and blinds the
eyes to the irritation of the poppy red flux. A cracked window
blind lets in Venus. Stars. The hand-lamp is too feeble to have
its own way. The vanity of their neck stretching, trying to be
large as a street-lamp sets him roaring to himself anew. And
rubber gloves, the color of moist dates, the identical glisten and
texture: means a ballon trip to Fez. So one is a ridiculous savior
of the poor, with fatigue always at his elbow with a new jest,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
the newest smutty story, the prettiest defiance of insipid pretences
that cannot again assert divine right—nonsensical gods that are
fit to lick shoes clean: and the great round face of Sister Palagia
straining to keep composure against the jaws of a body louse.
In at the back door. We have been a benefactor. The cross
laughter has been denied us but one cannot have more than the
appetite sanctions.</p>

<p>Awake early to the white blare of a sun flooding in sidewise.
Strip and bathe in it. Ha, but an ache tearing at your throat—and
a vague cinema lifting its black moon blot all out. There’s no
walking barefoot in the crisp leaves nowadays. There’s no
dancing save in the head’s dark. Go draped in soot; call on

glittering machine that runs without knowing to move. It is no
part of the eternal truth to wear white canvas shoes and a pink

To move at all is worse than murder, worse than Jack the Ripper.

of a fermenting language. Take Dante and his Tuscan dialect— It’s
a matter of position. The empty form drops from a cloud,
like a gourd from a vine; into it the poet packs his phallus-like
argument.</i></p>

<p>The red huckleberry bushes running miraculously along the
ground among the trees everywhere,   except where the land’s
tilled, these keep her from that tiredness the earth’s touch lays up
under the soles of feet. She runs beyond the wood   follows the
swiftest along the roads   laughing among the birch clusters   her
face in the yellow leaves   the curls before her eyes   her mouth
half open. This is a person in particular   there where they have
her—and I have only a wraith in the birch trees.</p>

<p><i>It is not the lusty bodies of the nearly naked girls in the
shows about town, nor the blare of the popular tunes that make
money for the manager. The girls can be procured rather more
easily in other ways and the music is dirt cheap. It is that this
meat is savored with a strangeness which never looses its fresh
taste to generation after generation, either of dancers or those
who watch. It is beauty escaping, spinning up over the heads,
blown out at the overtaxed vents by the electric fans.</i></p>

<p><i>In many poor and sentimental households it is a custom to
have cheap prints in glass frames upon the walls. These are of
all sorts and many sizes and may be found in any room from the
kitchen to the toilet. The drawing is always of the worst and the
colors, not gaudy but almost always of faint indeterminate tints,
are infirm. Yet a delicate accuracy exists between these prints
and the environment which breeds them. But as if to intensify
this relationship words are added. There will be a “sentiment”
as it is called, a rhyme, which the picture illuminates. Many of
these pertain to love. This is well enough when the bed is new
and the young couple spend the long winter nights there in
delightful seclusion. But childbirth follows in its time and a
motto still hangs above the bed. It is only then that the full
ironical meaning of these prints leaves the paper and the frame
and starting through the glass takes undisputed sway over the
household.</i></p>

<p>I like the boy. It’s years back I began to draw him to me—or
he was pushed my way by the others. And what if there’s
no sleep because the bed’s burning; is that a reason to send a chap
to Greystone! Greystone! There’s a name if you’ve any tatter
of mind left in you. It’s the long back, narrowing that way at
the waist perhaps whets the chisel in me. How the flanks flutter
and the heart races. Imagination! That’s the worm in the
apple. What if it run to paralyses and blind fires, here’s sense
loose in a world set on foundations. Blame buzzards for the eyes
they have.</p>

<p>Five miscarriages since January is a considerable record
Emily dear—but hearken to me: The Pleiades—that small cluster

<p><i>Carelessness of heart is a virtue akin to the small lights of

<p>Damn me I feel sorry for them. Yet syphilis is no more
than a wild pink in the rock’s cleft. I know that. Radicals and
capitalists doing a can-can tread the ground clean. Luck to the
feet then. Bring a Russian to put a fringe to the rhythm. What’s
the odds? Commiseration cannot solve calculus. Calculus is a
stone. Frost’ll crack it. Till then, there’s many a good back-road
among the clean raked fields of hell where autumn flowers
are blossoming.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>
<p><i>Pathology literally speaking is a flower garden. Syphilis
covers the body with salmon-red petals. The study of medicine
is an inverted sort of horticulture. Over and above all this floats
the philosophy of disease which is a stern dance. One of its
most delightful gestures is bringing flowers to the sick.</i></p>

<p>For a choice? Go to bed at three in the afternoon with
your clothes on: dreams for you! Here’s an old bonnefemme
in a pokebonnet staring into the rear of a locomotive. Or if
this prove too difficult take a horse-drag made of green limbs, a
kind of leaf cloth. Up the street with it! Ha, how the tar
clings. Here’s glee for the children. All’s smeared. Green’s
black. Leap like a devil, clap hands and cast around for more.
Here’s a pine wood driven head down into a mud-flat to build a
school on. Oh la, la! sand pipers made mathematicians at the
state’s cost.</p>

<p>There’s force to this cold sun, makes beard stubble stand
shinily. We look, we pretend great things to our glass—rubbing
our chin: This is a profound comedian who grimaces deeds into
slothful breasts. This is a sleepy president, without followers
save oak leaves—but their coats are of the wrong color. This
is a farmer—plowed a field in his dreams and since that time—goes
stroking the weeds that choke his furrows. This is a poet

<p><i>The simple expedient of a mirror has practical use for
arranging the hair, for observation of the set of a coat, etc. But
as an exercise for the mind the use of a mirror cannot be too

the mind for the enjoyment of its special prerogatives.</i></p>

<p>A man can shoot his spirit up out of a wooden house, that
is, through the roof—the roof’s slate—but how far? It is of
final importance to know that. To say the world turns under my
feet and that I watch it passing with a smile is neither the truth
nor my desire. But I would wish to stand—you’ve seen the
kingfisher do it—where the largest town might be taken in my
two hands, as high let us say as a man’s head—some one man
not too far above the clouds. What would I do then? Oh I’d
hold my sleeve over the sun awhile to make church bells ring.</p>

<p><i>There are divergences of humor that cannot be reconciled.
A young woman of much natural grace of manner and very apt at
a certain color of lie is desirous of winning the good graces of one

Instead of yielding to a superficial advantage she finally gives up
the task and continues in her own delicate bias of peculiar and
beautiful design much to the secret delight of the onlooker who
is thus regaled by the spectacle of two exquisite and divergent
natures playing one against the other.</i></p>

other in the ring of that music. “He saved a little then had to go
and die”. But isn’t it the same with all of us? Not at all.
Some laugh and laugh, with little grey eyes looking out through
the chinks—but not brown eyes rolled up in a full roar. One
can’t have everything.</p>

<p>The particular thing, whether it be four pinches of four
divers white powders cleverly compounded to cure surely, safely,
pleasantly a painful twitching of the eyelids or say a pencil
sharpened at one end, dwarfs the imagination, makes logic a
butterfly, offers a finality that sends us spinning through space, a
fixity the mind could climb forever, a revolving mountain, a complexity
with a surface of glass: the gist of poetry. <i>D. C. al fin.</i></p>

<p>There is no thing that with a twist of the imagination cannot
be something else. Porpoises risen in a green sea, the wind at
nightfall bending the rose-red grasses and you—in your apron

summer!—neither a copse for resurrected frost eaters   but a
summer removed   undestroyed   a summer of dried leaves
scurrying with a screech, to and fro in the half dark—twittering,
chattering, scraping. Hagh!</p>

<p><i>Seeing the leaves dropping from the high and low branches
the thought rises: this day of all others is the one chosen, all
other days fall away from it on either side and only itself remains
in perfect fulness. It is its own summer, of its leaves as they
scrape on the smooth ground it must build its perfection. The
gross summer of the year is only a halting counterpart of those
fiery days of secret triumph which in reality themselves paint the
year as if upon a parchment, giving each season a mockery of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
warmth or frozeness which is within ourselves. The true seasons
blossom or wilt not in fixed order but so that many of them may
pass in a few weeks or hours whereas sometimes a whole life
passes and the season remains of a piece from one end to the
other.</i></p>

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity

is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER

the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
